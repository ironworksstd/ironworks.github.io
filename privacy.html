Fall Ball — Privacy Policy
Last updated: January 15, 2026

Introduction
IronWorks Studios ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect personal data when you use the mobile game Fall Ball. By using Fall Ball you agree to the practices described below.
Data we collect
Name: If you choose to provide a player name, that name is stored locally on your device.
No other personal data is collected by the game itself.
Storage and retention
Local storage only: All data collected by Fall Ball (the player name and any offline save data) is stored only on your device. We do not transmit or back up this data to our servers or any third party.
Retention: Data remains on your device until you delete the app, clear the app data, or change/delete the name within the game.
In-app purchases
Fall Ball offers in-app purchases. Purchases are processed through the platform’s app store (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play). Payment information and purchase records are handled by the platform; we do not collect or store your payment details.
Receipts and purchase history are managed by the app store and subject to their policies.
Unity services and third‑party processing (important)
Use of Unity services: Fall Ball may integrate Unity Technologies’ services (for example: Unity Analytics, Unity Ads, Unity Authentication, Unity Cloud Diagnostics, Unity In-App Purchasing, Unity Multiplayer, Unity Performance Reporting, and other Unity Services). If you enable or we use any Unity service, Unity may collect device and usage data as described in Unity’s documentation. Typical data that Unity services can collect includes: installation identifiers, device identifiers, device model, OS version, IP address, crash logs, performance metrics, session and usage telemetry, and aggregated analytics. Unity services may also process custom events if the game sends them.
Your data with Unity: Unity acts as a third‑party processor/controller for any data collected by their services. We do not send the locally-stored player name to Unity, and by default Fall Ball does not transmit personal data off-device. If Unity services are enabled in the future, Unity’s servers may receive telemetry and non-identifying technical data unless collection is explicitly disabled or consent is obtained.
What this means for you: If you want to keep Fall Ball strictly local-only, do not enable Unity services that transmit telemetry. If Unity services are enabled, you may need to consent to telemetry collection depending on your jurisdiction and device settings. We will not share personal data (beyond what Unity collects via its SDKs) or sell it.
No ads / tracking (current status)
Fall Ball does not contain advertisements.
We do not use third‑party advertising or tracking services that collect personal data while the game remains configured for local-only saves.
Data sharing and disclosure
We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal data to third parties except as described in Section 5 for Unity services if enabled, or as required by law.
Because we store player names and saves locally, we cannot access or provide that data from our servers.
Security
Local data protection: Device-level security (screen lock, backups you enable) determines protection for locally stored data. Keep device software updated and use built-in security features.
App safeguards: We implement reasonable measures to protect local save files within the app; however, no local storage is entirely immune to compromise.
Children
Fall Ball is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian who becomes aware that your child provided us with personal data, please delete the app or contact us.
